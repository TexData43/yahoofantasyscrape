Uses the Yahoo API to pull fantasy baseball info from my leagues

You have to setup an App with Yahoo to get a consumer key and secret to replace the ones loaded by the R script.

I liked to use the XML package to parse the yahoo data. There is probably a more efficient way to get to the end but the longer route helps me figure out the structure of the data.
